// 5 FixStart
//
// Create a function called fixStart. It should take a single argument,
//a string, and return a version where all occurences of its first character
//have been replaced with '*', except for the first character itself.
//You can assume that the string is at least one character long. For example:
//
// fixStart('babble'): 'ba**le'
