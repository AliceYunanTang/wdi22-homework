//why does cheat sheet refer to arguments as parameters
// i don't understand step 4


// Part 2
//
// Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and
//perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier1:
//
// 1 Take half of the number and store the result.
// 2 Square the result of #1 and store that result.
// 3 Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.
// 4 Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).
